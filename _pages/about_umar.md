I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Hunter College, graduating in May 2025, with minors in Asian American Studies and Mathematics. My main interests include data science and machine learning, with a particular passion for building efficient, impactful projects that leverage data-driven insights.

I have experience working with programming languages such as Python, C++, Java (Spring Boot), along with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL databases (Neo4j, MongoDB) for integrating and analyzing data in my applications.

Through multiple internships at MetLife, I've developed practical skills in data science, including optimizing semantic search results, ML pipelines & monitoring services, and data visualization. Additionally, my role as an undergraduate research assistant at Hunter College's Distributed AI Research Lab has allowed me to explore innovative uses of reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms.

In addition to my major, I pursued a minor in Asian-American Studies, for which I was awarded the 2023-2024 Asian-American Scholarship for AAS Minors.

Feel free to connect with me if you have opportunities for collaboration or want to discuss data science and technology!
